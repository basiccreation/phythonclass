Trivia Game

The Program Spec:

    This is a Astro Physics Trivia game for two
    players. Taking turns, each player answers a
    total of five questions, the game has a total
    of ten questions.

    The player earns a point for each correct
    answer. They are notified if their answer is
    correct or given the correct answer if their
    answer is incorrect.
    
    At the end, the winner is declared -- or a tie.
