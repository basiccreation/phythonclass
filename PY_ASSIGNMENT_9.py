Trivia Game

The Program Spec:

    Each player will take turn answering a total of
    10 questions. 5 for each player.  If the player
    selects the correct answer, they earn a point.    
    At the end, a winner is declared.

    -------------------------------------------------
    
     
    Create a run and include it as output with your program.
    Be sure to show that the validation works for the
    possible answers.
