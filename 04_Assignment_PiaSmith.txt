The Rock Paper Scissors Game Program
------------------------------------

This program mimics the children's game of the same name or Rochambeau as it
is also called.

Player will select either Rock, Paper or Scissor. Computer's play is
selected randomly.

    - Rock beats Scissors (by smashing them)
    - Paper beats Rock (by wrapping it)
    - Scissors beat Paper (by cutting it)
    - If both make the same choice, they go again

This game is won by the side that has the highest score after five won games,
ties don't count.

After the game, the player is asked whether they want to play one more again.
